Warhammer 40k Battle Tracker
======

This is a very basic Warhammer 40k Battle Tracker that I built for keeping track of victory and command points when playing Warhammer with my friends.

This was mostly a fun project for learning a bit of React, but also a more fun way to keep track of points than using pen and paper.

For creating the initial app I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and for deploying it to github pages I used [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

The deployed version of the app can be found at: http://kimtorberntsson.com/warhammer-40k-battle-tracker/

Here follow some common commands for myself when working with the project:
* Starting the app when developing: npm start
* Deploy to github pages: npm run deploy
* Create a build locally: npm run build
